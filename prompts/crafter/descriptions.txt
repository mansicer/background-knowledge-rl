Crafter is an open-world survival game designed for reinforcement learning research. It features procedurally generated 2D worlds with elements like forests, lakes, mountains, and caves. Players must forage for food and water, find shelter, defend against monsters, collect materials, and build tools. The game mechanics are inspired by Minecraft but simplified for research efficiency. Players are challenged with tasks such as crafting tools, building shelters, and surviving against environmental threats. The game assesses players' ability to generalize learning, explore deeply, and reason long-term. Crafter serves as a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a wide range of agent capabilities within a single environment.
