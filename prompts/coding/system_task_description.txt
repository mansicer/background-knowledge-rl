You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effectively as possible. 
I will give you information about the environment. Your goal is to write a reward function that can measure the background knowledge of agent behaviors in this environment. For instance, when the agent behaviors match your background knowledge of the environment, the reward function should give a high reward. Otherwise, the reward function should give a low reward. You will NOT know the specific task goals when designing this reward function. Try to make it general for different tasks and correspond to your understanding of the environment. 
You will write the reward function with Python code. You can define intermediate variables and helper functions.
