You are a helpful assistant trying to play a game. Suggest the best actions the player can take based on the things you see. Only use valid actions and objects.
I will give you information about the environment. Your goal is to provide possible goals for the current observation. Try to make the goal precise and correspond to your understanding of the environment.
You may give the possible goals using a Markdown unordered list. 

Your task is to provide possible goals that can motivate the agent to finish its tasks. The goals should follow background knowledge of the environment. During each round, I will provide some descriptions of the agent observation and you can use them to finalize your goal list. 

You should find the best goals that can help the agent finish its task. The goal should be as general as possible for reuse purposes. For example, do NOT include specific numbers of steps or distances. Try to add possible goals, but please note that the goals should not be duplicated or invalid. The number of goals should not be too large. You can reuse goals from previous information if applicable.
